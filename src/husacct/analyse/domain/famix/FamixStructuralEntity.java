 * The Class StructuralEntity. A StructuralEntity represents the definition in
 * source code of a structural entity, i.e. it denotes an aspect of the state of
 * a system. The different kinds of structural entities mainly differ in
 * lifetime: some have the same lifetime as the entity they belong to, e.g. an
 * attribute and a class, some have a lifetime that is the same as the whole
 * system, e.g. a global variable. Subclasses of this class represent different
 * mechanisms for defining such an entity. StructuralEntity is an abstract class
 * inheriting from Entity. Besides inherited attributes, it has the following
 * attributes:

	 * model refers to the type of the defined structure. Typically this will be
	 * a class, a pointer or a primitive type (e.g. "int" in Java). declaredType
	 * is null if the return type is not known or the empty string (i.e. "") if
	 * the StructuralEntity does not have a return type (for instance, the C++
	 * void; we donâ€™t use "void", because this causes problems for languages
	 * where it is possible to define a class called "void", like for instance
	 * Smalltalk and Ada). Note that this is consistent with UML 1.1 [Booc96a].
	 * Note that we need a language dependent interpretation to link a type name
	 * to a class name, because in most OO languages, types are not always
	 * equivalent to a class. How the declaredType may be recognised in source
	 * code and how the type matches to a class are language dependent issue.

	 * (such as "int" in Java), or something else depending on the language.
	 * Therefore, the declaredClass will contain the name of the class which is
	 * designated already by the declaredType, or the name of the class where
	 * the declaredType points to, null if it is unknown if there is an implicit
	 * class in the declared type, and the empty string (i.e. "") if it is known
	 * that there is no implicit class in the declaredReturnType. What exactly
